    <h2>
        Parent-Staff Communication Communication is ongoing throughout the year.
        Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. 
        Phone calls	and/or emails by classroom teachers	 to	discuss your childâ€™s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. 
        If you feel you	need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. 
        Teachers can be	reached by phone or email after the	school	day is over.
